    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Cuilcagh Park is one of the largest native peatland environments left in Northern Ireland.
    Peatland is one of our most extensive and underrated environments, making up around 10% of all available land types in the country.
    Peatlands are globally scarce habitats, with the UK and Ireland as a whole accounting for 20% of all peatland globally[1].
    Sadly, extensive use of peat by humans for home heating and industry has left many peatlands unsustainably damaged.
    Environmental groups such as Ulster Wildlife been working to secure the land and restore the bog to make a home for it's many
    inhabitants and to preserve it for future wildlife, flora and human visitors.

    Many of the creatures that can be found in Cuilcagh like the Irish Hare and Hen Harrier are on Northern Ireland's Priority Species list. This makes it an
    even more important place to look after so we can help the decreasing populations of these creatures!

    <p>This app wants to help raise awareness of the fantastic upland bog at Cuilcagh. It's a home to many creatures,
      and Spotters like you can help us understand more about the wildlife that lives here. If we're lucky,
      you'll be able to help us understand more about Cuilcagh's animals and plants, and how they change over time!
